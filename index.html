                    In this 3rd year project we were tasked with a given programt that was not thread-safe.

                    The goal of this was to adapt the program into a thread-safe version. This was achieved by using many different
                    ways such as:
                        - Locks or synchronized code
                        - thread-safe versions of collections
                        - Executors

                    This is a 3rd year module created by Sonica, a group consisting of myself and 3 others.

                    This is a FullStack website that is developed with students in mind. This allows for students to find
                    work experience either within their university or in their local community. 
                    
                    There are currently 5 pages which consist of:
                        - Index - This is for the log-in and sign-up
                        - Home - This contains info on your next shift, a mini calendar, app news and a customized welcome message with the users name
                        - Calendar - This contains use of an open source calendar to add and display events stored in the server side.
                        - Profile - This displays user info and allows for updating the info also.
                        - Placements - This is a page that will be further implemented, it will be a place for companies to advertise their placements more locally

                <h2>AI For Problem Solving</h2>
                <p>Languages used: Java</p>
                <p>
                    This is a 3rd year project in which I was tasked with implementing an A* search algorithm to solve a puzzle
                    using a given aips library.

                    The puzzle contained 3 cities (A,B,C) where there are fixed costs of travel between each city
                    and a cost of moving cargo per ton per city. The truck has a maximum load. We had to intake an initial state and a goal state.

                    The search was implemented using different classes and functions some key ones were:
                     - Successor function: Gathered all possible next moves
                     - ApplyAction function: was used so the actions could be applied to the current state
                     - Heuristic function: This had to never over-estimate the cost otherwise the A* search would not work

                    Vita is a News/Social Media website. It contains 7 pages with the following breakdown:
                    Index - Info on wesbite, also where log-in / sign-up is done.
                    Dashboard - Makes use of a news API to display current news and allows users to make posts.
                    Profile - Where the user can see their own posts and their who they're friends with etc.
                    Settings - Where the user can customize their account info, add a profile pic or cover pic.
                    Weather - Makes use of the METOffice API to give current weather info for the users location.

                    This is a 2nd year Advanced Software Design and Development project
                    
                    This implements 3 basic account types:
                        - Basic account
                        - ISA
                        - Reward Account
                    
                    This is a basic banking app that makes use of object-orientated modelling
                    and design concepts concerning inheritance, interfaces and abstract classes.

                    This was achieved by using JavaFX for the GUI which was connected to a domain implementation
                    created from a given class diagram that modelled the basic components.

                <h2>Airport Device</h2>
                <p>Languages used: Python</p>
                <p>
                    This is a 2nd year Internet Of Things project and was created in a team of myself and 2 others.

                    This consists of 3 different devices that all make use of a raspberry pi and connected devices. These were all linked
                    together and communicated data between each of them.

                    The Baggage Device subscribes to MQTT (sonica/baggage) to recieve messages published and then further
                    publishes and forwards data to Adafruit in which it is stored. This device is used to scan baggage tags
                    and direct baggage to the appropriate gate via conveyor.

                    The Weather Device pushes to MQTT (sonica/water) to send messages about water detection and other
                    weather data. All data collected is then pushed to the Adafruit dashboard which allows for the end user
                    to have an overall view of the airport sensors

                    The Air Traffic Device, detects aircraft and guides them to where they need to be or go.
                    This data is then sent to Adafruit to create a dashboard with this information.
